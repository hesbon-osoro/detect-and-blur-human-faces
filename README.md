## Intro
Content moderation is very necessary for a website. If you are developing a website where users can upload images, then you have to be extra cautious. You canâ€™t trust your users. If they upload some objectionable content, then sometimes you as a creator of the site, become the victim of it.

In every modern web 2.0 application, a content moderation system is present. Some popular websites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have both automatic and manual content moderation systems in place.

But for a small team and individual developer, manual content moderation is not feasible and not very economical. Therefore we can use artificial intelligence (AI) based automation to detect any objectionable content and blur it out.

Building AI-based automation is not very easy. You have to hire a talented developer and should have a lot of data to train your AI model. But we can take a shortcut here. There are much software as a service (SaaS) platforms present in the market, which can help us in this aspect.
[`Pixlab`](https://pixlab.io/) is a SaaS platform, which can give a user-friendly application programming interface (API) to their state-of-the-art AI models. You can easily integrate those services into your app. Check out this [`link`](https://pixlab.io/cmdls) for more information.
